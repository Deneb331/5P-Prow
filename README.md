Hello,

I am very sorry, but due to an intensive time at work during the last month, as I had to do a lot of extra hours, and a lot of difficulties working on the project that took longer than expected to solve, I am very sad to submit this project incomplete. I am doing this very frustrated, as I have put a lot of effort in this, but this time it was just impossible for me. I would like to know when I can continue working on it and when is going to be my next deadline.

Thank you, and I am very sorry for the inconveniences.

Kind regards, 

Juan Jos√© Ruiz Ruiz.
